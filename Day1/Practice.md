      2. Practice the simple example which is covered in Phase-1.
      3. Setup a job in Jenkins as to: Code checkout --> Build(compile-->test-->package-->deploy to Nexus) --> deploy to tomcat. (as guided in Phase-1 docs)
      4. Schedule the job to run everyday morning 6am & evening 6pm. (Build Periodical)
      5. Schedule the job to run for every check-in. (GitHub Push)
      6. Install any plugin, ex: "Nested view plugin" (Manage Jenkins --> Manage Plugins --> Available --> search for this and install).
